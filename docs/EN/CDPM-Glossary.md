# Glossary

This chapter compiles key terms of the CDPM approach in alphabetical order. Cross-references (see also) help to quickly understand relationships.

## A

**Action Item (AI)**

Context-bound, accountable activity with measurable impact on time/budget/scope/goals. Lifecycle: Proposed → (Refine/Split/Merge) → Committed → In Progress → Blocked/At Risk → Done/Cancelled.

*See also: Guidance, Success Criteria, Triad.*

**Analysis (Building Block)**

Continuous verification of the context for completeness, plausibility, consistency, alignment with goals, critical paths, and forecast scenarios. The result is a set of prioritized findings with guidance impulses.

*See also: Context, Rolling Forecast, What-if Analysis.*

**Artifact**

Derived view (e.g., Gantt, Backlog, Risk Register, Report). In CDPM always "thin" and never leading; the source is the context.

*See also: Projection, Context First.*

**Audit Trail / Commit Log**

Decision-related change history of the context with metadata (Who? When? Why? Expected Impact?).

*See also: Versioning, Baseline.*

## B

**Baseline**

Reference state of the context at defined points in time; serves comparability. Between baselines, the rolling forecast applies.

*See also: Rolling Forecast, Versioning.*

**Budget / Budget Item**

Financial framework at total or item level, semantically linked with goals, milestones, and action items.

*See also: Triad, Projection.*

## C

**CDPM (Context Driven Project Management)**

A meta-framework that enhances classic & agile approaches with a leading context layer (SSOT), enabling AI effectiveness and verifiable control.

*See also: Context, SSOT.*

**Commit (Context Commit)**

An approved context change (by the PRO) with a demonstrated effect (time/budget/scope/goal) and source reference(s).

*See also: Distillate, Audit Trail.*

**Confidence (AI Suggestion)**

A self-assessment of the certainty and evidence supporting an AI suggestion, intended to aid the PRO's review.

*See also: AI, Governance.*

**Context (Project Context)**

A structured, versioned model of the project's reality (Goals, Scope, Timeline, Budget, Risks, Dependencies, Success Criteria, Milestones, Action Items, Commit Log) as an SSOT.

*See also: Context First, Projection, Versioning.*

**Context First**

Principle: Changes become effective first in the context; views/artifacts update from there.

*See also: Projection, SSOT.*

**Context Freshness**

Metric for the currency of the context (e.g., share of fields/relationships < x days).

*See also: Delta Latency, Forecast Stability.*

**Context Leadership**

An organizational principle stating that the context is the single source of truth, from which all artifacts are projected.

*See also: SSOT, Context First.*

**Context/Analysis/Guidance/Update/Distillation/Reporting Agent**

AI agent roles in CDPM: generate/verify context, create forecasts & scenarios, derive AIs, distill updates, and generate reports - always read → propose → justify, without auto-commit.

*See also: AI, Governance.*

**Coverage**

Metric: Share of action items with explicit goal reference/dependencies.

*See also: Success Criteria, Analysis.*

**Critical Path**

Chain dependency whose delay directly shifts the end date; is continuously recalculated in the context.

*See also: Dependency, Timeline.*

## D

**Daily Distillation Window**

Daily short ritual (10-20 min) for reviewing & committing small distillates.

*See also: Distillate, PRO.*

**Delta Latency**

Metric: Time from raw update to context commit (or to AI suggestion).

*See also: Context Freshness, Distillation.*

**Dependency**

A relationship between context elements (e.g., AI ↔ Milestone/Component), whose impact on time, budget, or risk is computationally determined within the context.

*See also: Critical Path, Projection, Rolling Forecast.*

**Distillate**

An update targeting a single component of the project context (e.g., a requirement, a risk). The impacts on time, budget, and scope are derived from this change.

*See also: Update, Commit, Triad.*

## E

**Extension Components**

Optional context parts (e.g., Stakeholders, Budget Items) supplementing the basic components.

*See also: Context, Stakeholder.*

## F

**Forecast Stability**

Metric: Variance of target dates/budgets over time; delta to baseline.

*See also: Baseline, Rolling Forecast.*

## G

**Governance Board / Sponsorship**

Decides strategic trade-offs and signs decisions verifiably; consumes projections (roadmap, forecast, scenarios).

*See also: PRO, Projection.*

**Guidance**

The translation of context & analysis into prioritized action items, including splitting/merging, re-prioritization, and status changes.

*See also: Action Item, Analysis, Prioritization.*

## M

**Milestone**

Temporally defined control/delivery point, semantically linked with goals, AIs, dependencies, and budget effect.

*See also: Projection, Timeline, Success Criteria.*

**MV-CDPM (Minimal Viable CDPM)**

Smallest operational setup: Basic context, first analysis, top AIs, distillation channel, rolling forecast projection, baseline-0.

*See also: Baseline, Rolling Forecast.*

## O

**Outcome Alignment**

Metric: Progress of success criteria in relation to effort/costs.

*See also: Success Criteria, Reporting.*

## P

**Pending Update**

Unvalidated raw signal (mail, meeting, ticket, etc.); becomes part of project truth only after distillation & commit.

*See also: Update, Distillate.*

**Portfolio Management (in CDPM)**

Comparability of heterogeneous projects via standardized contexts; enables objective resource/trade-off decisions.

*See also: SSOT, Projection.*

**Prioritization (Heuristic)**

Ranking for AIs along goal contribution, risk reduction/criticality path, time effect, budget effect, maturity.

*See also: Guidance, Analysis.*

**PRO (Project Owner)**

The person responsible for the context. They lead the distillation process, prioritize guidance, set baselines, and approve commits. Reporting emerges as a projection from the context.

*See also: Governance, Daily Distillation Window.*

**Projection (View)**

An automatically or semi-automatically derived representation of the context (e.g., roadmap/Gantt, backlog, risk register, report, financial view).

*See also: Artifact, Context First.*

## R

**RACI**

A role model defining responsibilities: R=Responsible (PRO for context/distillation), A=Accountable (Sponsor/Board), C=Consulted (Subject Matter Experts), I=Informed (the organization via reports).

*See also: Governance, PRO.*

**Re-Evaluation (of AIs)**

The reassessment or adjustment of action items in response to context changes (e.g., re-prioritization, splits/merges, status changes).

*See also: Guidance, Prioritization.*

**Reporting (Automated)**

Status, delta, risk, and financial reports generated as byproducts of the context, eliminating the need for double maintenance.

*See also: Projection, Outcome Alignment.*

**Risk Burn-down**

The reduction of the overall weighted risk exposure achieved through completed AIs or countermeasures.

*See also: Analysis, Success Criteria.*

**Roadmap / Gantt (Thin Artifacts)**

Temporal projection from milestones, dependencies, and AIs - without independent truth.

*See also: Projection, Context First.*

**Rolling Forecast**

Continuously updated forecast (time/budget/scope) between baselines; responds immediately to commits.

*See also: Baseline, What-if Analysis.*

## S

**Scope**

Extent/performance content of the project; one side of the triad (time-budget-scope).

*See also: Triad, Scope Creep.*

**Scope Creep**

Creeping scope expansion without transparent impact analysis; is contained in CDPM through context obligation & distillation.

*See also: Scope, Distillate.*

**Single Source of Truth (SSOT)**

Single, leading truth: the context. All views derive from it.

*See also: Context First, Projection.*

**Splitting/Merging (AIs)**

Decomposition or consolidation of AIs for controllability/redundancy avoidance.

*See also: Guidance, Prioritization.*

**Stakeholder**

Participants/affected parties who generate updates, deliver content, implement AIs - without context approval authority.

*See also: Extension Components, PRO.*

**Success Criteria**

Measurable success indicators of project goals; linked with AIs, risks, milestones, and budget effect.

*See also: Outcome Alignment, Prioritization.*

## T

**Timeline (Working Days/WD)**

Time axis including milestones/dates; effects are shown as deltas (e.g., +10 WD).

*See also: Critical Path, Rolling Forecast.*

**Tool-Agnostic**

Context model is independent of tool stack (Jira, MS Project, SharePoint, etc.); integration via connectors.

*See also: SSOT, Projection.*

**Triad (Time-Budget-Scope)**

Explicitly controlled tension field; every decision produces a transparent trade-off.

*See also: What-if Analysis, Rolling Forecast.*

## U

**Update**

Any signal with potential project impact; becomes effective only as distillate after PRO approval.

*See also: Pending Update, Distillation.*

## V

**Versioning**

Decision-related, audit-capable tracking of changes including technical deltas and justifications.

*See also: Audit Trail, Baseline.*

## W

**Watermelon Effect**

Status green outside, red inside - arises from artifact-centric cosmetics; CDPM addresses this with context leadership & metrics.

*See also: Reporting, Analysis.*

**Weekly Context Review**

Weekly ritual for discussing analysis findings, critical paths, and prioritizing guidance.

*See also: Analysis, Guidance.*

**What-if Analysis / Scenario**

Simulation of variants (e.g., "+1 team → -3 weeks at +90k"), with immediately visible triad effects in the context.

*See also: Rolling Forecast, Triad.*
