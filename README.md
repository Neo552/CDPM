# Context-Driven Project Management (CDPM)

Transform projects context-centrically with Artificial Intelligence

## What is CDPM?

CDPM is a meta-framework for modern project management that establishes the **project context as the Single Source of Truth**. It makes projects AI-ready and combines classic predictability with agile adaptability.

## Core Principle

```
Context → Analysis → Guidance → Updates → Context*
```

*Rolling, SSOT-driven cycle

## Key Features

- **Living Project Context**: Complete, current project truth with goals, scope, budget, timeline, risks, and action items
- **AI-Native Design**: Structured data foundation that maximizes AI value in project management
- **Holistic Project Triad**: Time-Budget-Scope effects visible in every decision
- **Atomic Destillation**: Complex updates broken down into individually validatable effects

## Quick Start

1. Create base context (Goals, Scope, Timeline, Budget)
2. Implement AI connection
3. Run first analysis
4. Establish destillation channels
5. Introduce Daily Destillation Window
